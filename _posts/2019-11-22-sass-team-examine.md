- Are there tenants who will demand some level of isolation from other tenants?
- Are there tenants who will be willing to run in a fully shared environment?
- Are there optimizations, workflows, or product features that could be offered as value-added options?
- Are there any significant variations in how each tenant may need to respond to spikes in user load/activity?
